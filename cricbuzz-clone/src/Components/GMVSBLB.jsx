                            his team errupt in celebrations. Three weeks, a lot of runs, a lot of wickets, a lot of rain,

                            lot of serious cricket. Hope you enjoyed reading us through all the games, and until next time,

                            <b>Mayank Agarwal | Losing skipper:</b> The fight everyone put up was fantastic. The never die
                            attitude was there but Chethan and Kranthi showed the fight. We knew the wicket would get better
                            to bat on, but we lost three quick wickets. LR and Kranthi did really well to get us close. The
                            team was fantastic. Big credit to them for the way they fought and played through the league
                            stage. Different people stepped up at different times. LR Chethan has been the find of the
                            tournament. Our fans were the backbone for us.

                            <b>Rohan Patil | MoS:</b> Really proud of my team and the way Manish Pandey led the team. I'll
                            continue this performance. We tried to hit as fast as possible in the powerply. Proud of the way
                            Dev and Pandey continued in the end. As a bowling unit as well we came pretty hard.

                            <b>Manish Pandey | Winning skipper | MoM:</b> We were outplayed the last time we played this
                            team and we wanted to play the finals against the second best team in the tournament. It was a
                            handsome score for us to defend. Anything over 200 was what we were looking at because the
                            wicket was playing beautifully. We wanted this kind of an innings from our openers. We wanted to
                            play the powerplay well. Very proud of the boys. The new ball holds a bit with the spinners and
                            luckily it paid off. I did it in the last game as well. Both Bhandage and Padikkal have done
                            well for us through the season. Love to have people like that in my team. [On his batting] That
                            was all I could do then. I had one signal and went after it and got good runs at the end of it.
                            Really happy with the fans and the owners. Really happy with the way the boys have played. The
                            kind of attitude the guys had was unbelievable. Hopefully we play as a team next year. Everybody
                            has learnt a lot and achieved a lot. As a captain, I want the whole XI performing all the time.
                            We always play to win. We want to put up a good fight on the field and I did think of getting
                            here and winning the trophy. The sponsors, the coaching staff and everyone have worked around to
                            make this tournament a great one.

                            <b>23:07 Local Time, 17:37 GMT, 23:07 IST:</b> The fireworks go off at the Chinnaswamy. And once
                            again, on the big night of the finals, it is the age-old strategy of putting on the big runs on
                            the board that does the trick. But make no mistake, the Blasters, after a horrible start, sent a
                            real scare down the spine of the Mystics. Just when they'd look down and out, a flurry of
                            boundaries would come out of nowhere, and the equation and the match would bounce back into
                            equilibrium. Agarwal fell early. Marathe, Rakshit, Joshi and Suchith fell for single digits
                            inside the first ten overs itself. But Chethan LR kept swinging around, got a good partner in
                            Kranthi Kumar, and together they made brought Bengaluru back into the hunt. Alas, chasing 221
                            needed more than just a blinder. And more than just the one partnership. In the end, what
                            matters is that Gulbarga held their nerves, brushed off the scare, and now have their silverware
                            ..
