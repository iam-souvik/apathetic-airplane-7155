                    <div>Abhilash Shetty to R More, no run, yep, legal, and nothing else matters. <b>Gulbarga Mystics:
                            Champions 2022</b>. More heaves, gets a big inside-edge, and short fine leg cleans up. Start

                        inside the tramline. Wow. Just legal. More swings, and doesn't connect. That should be it,
                        unless there's something even more dramatic</div>

                        to the wrong end to enable the second run</div>

                    <div>Abhilash Shetty to Rishi Bopanna, out Rishi Bopanna Run Out!! 1 run completed. Pandey has the
                        final laugh. Bopanna jams it to him again at long-on, and despite the ball getting to him a lot
                        quicker, turns to get back on strike immediately. But More sends him back, to his doom. <b>

                        Bopanna takes on Pandey's throw with a dive to make it back in for the second. Succeeds</div>

                    <div>Abhilash Shetty to Rishi Bopanna, <b>FOUR</b>, yea, that shoukd help. A full, wide delivery,
                        and Bopanna carves it inside-out, over extra cover</div>

                    <div><b>48</b></div>
                    <div>C Wood to Jordan Cox, no run, and there is that spongy bounce which takes the batter by surprise. Jordan Cox looks to push at an angled across delivery but is undone by the little movement and the extra bounce</div>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div><b>47</b></div>
                    <div>Nathan Ellis to Will Jacks,<b> FOUR</b>, fuller length delivery, Will Jacks gets his both feet out of the way to slam it wide of mid-on for a four. Created room to free his arms and didn't lose his shape while making contact</div>

                    <div>C Wood to Jordan Cox, 1 run, length delivery, the batter pushes that one down to mid-off with hard hands and steals a single. There was an attempted shy at the bowler's end but the batter had made it</div>

                    <div>Rossington at the top, and Thomspon towards the later stages - they were the only two batters who chipped in with handy contributions. The London innings was deprived of any sort of momentum as the bowlers kept taking wickets at regular intervals and were economical at the same time. Sam Curran with three wickets to his name was the pick of the bowlers, and Tom Curran didn't give anything away either. The Invinclbles should be able to chase this down with the kind of batting line-up they have. Back in 10 minutes for the second essay..</div>

                    <div>Sam Curran to Dawson, no ball, 1 run, waist high full toss by Sam Curran and Dawson tries to heave it through the leg-side, gets a single though. No ball and that's a free hit coming up!</div>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div><b>42</b></div>
                    <div>Tom Curran to Dawson, 1 run, low full toss on off, Dawson tries to scoop this towards fine leg, but ends up hitting it straight on to the helmet grille. Ouch! They take a single as the ball rolls into the leg-side</div>
                </div>

                    <div><b>41</b></div>
                    <div>Sam Curran to Bopara, out Lbw!! Bopara departs after playing cameo. Takes a DRS along with him as well. This was pitched up by Tom Curran around middle and Bopara tried to play this through the leg-side. Gets rapped on the pads, and the Hawkeye confirms this might have crashed into the stumps. As plumb as it could get. <b> Bopara lbw b Sam Curran 19(16) [4s-3]</b>x</div>
